# Automobile Price Prediction Model

A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts automobile prices using advanced regression techniques and feature engineering. This project demonstrates end-to-end data science workflow from exploratory data analysis to model deployment, achieving an Adjusted R² score of 0.6723 with XGBoost.

## Business Problem Statement

The automotive industry faces significant challenges in pricing vehicles competitively while maintaining profitability. Traditional pricing methods often rely on subjective assessments and limited market data, leading to:

- Inconsistent pricing strategies across different vehicle segments
- Difficulty in determining optimal price points for new models
- Limited understanding of feature impact on vehicle valuation
- Challenges in competitive market positioning

This project addresses these challenges by developing a data-driven pricing model that provides accurate price predictions based on vehicle specifications, enabling manufacturers and dealers to make informed pricing decisions.
